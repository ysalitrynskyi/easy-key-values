## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I display a value on a post or page?

Simply use the shortcode `[ekv_value key="your_key_name"]` to show the value of a key wherever shortcodes are supported.

### Can I access a value within my theme or plugin?

Absolutely, by embedding `<?php echo ekv_get_value('your_key_name'); ?>`, you can easily retrieve and display a value
